## Brief

A module is required that has an algorithm to find all pairs of integers within an array that sum to a specified value.

- The input should include the array of integers and the specified value. 
- The output should include all pairs of integers that sum to the specified value.
- Think carefully about any error handling that may be required.
- Unit tests should be produced to ensure all functionality works as expected.
